# Chapter 11

Until now, the Lord described His presence as 
From this, we know that the entire universe 
Arjuna got to know these unique characteristics of the Lord from the Lord Himself. He realized that the form, state and activity of this entire universe are subject to His will. Affirming this realization, Arjuna speaks of his desire to see the Lord in such a form. The Lord is pleased and Arjuna actually sees The Lord in this form.
All this will be described in this chapter.

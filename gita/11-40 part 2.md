`त्वम् अनन्त वीर्य` `[tvam ananta vIrya]` You have unlimited valor `अमित विक्रमः` `[amita vikramaH]` and infinite might. `समाप्नोषि` `[samApnoSi]` You pervade as the Self in everything, `ततः` `[tataH]` hence `सर्वः असि` `[sarvaH asi]` You are everything.

‘Valor’ is the ability to perform great deeds while being unaffected as a result of doing them. 
With unlimited valor, You have infinite might and are present [as the Self](universe_as_his_body) in everything. Hence You are everything. Since You pervade all conscious and non-conscious things as their Self, they are present [as Your body](universe_as_his_body). 
In this way, You alone are addressed by all words. 
It was mentioned in [Chap.11#37](_37_part_2) ‘You are the imperishable, You are the outcome and the origin’ and in [Chap.10#39](_39_part_1) ‘You are the wind, restraint, fire, the atmosphere, the ocean, the moon, the leader of people, and their great-grandfather - their origin’. You have equivalence to everything - that's because You are present as the Self in everything. This is described appropriately in [Chap.11#38](_38_part_2) ‘You are the One with an unending form; the universe is pervaded by You’.

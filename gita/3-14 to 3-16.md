`भूतानि` `[bhUtAni]` Bodies of conscious beings `भवन्ति` `[bhavanti]` are made `अन्नात्` `[annAt]` from food. `अन्न` `[anna]` Food `सम्भवः` `[sambhavaH]` is created `पर्जन्यात्` `[parjanyAt]` using rain water. `पर्जन्यः` `[parjanyaH]` Rain `भवति` `[bhavati]` is a result of `यज्ञ` `[yajJa]` a method of
`विद्धि` `[viddhi]` Know that `कर्म` `[karma]` actions `ब्रह्मोद्भवम्` `[brahmodbhavam]` result from the environment. `ब्रह्म अक्षर समुद्भवम्` `[brahma akSara samudbhavam]` The environment comes alive as your body by virtue of the indestructible Self. `तस्मात्` `[tasmAt]` Thus, `सर्वगतम्` `[sarvagatam]` the ubiquitous `ब्रह्म` `[brahma]` environment `नित्यम् प्रतिष्ठितम्` `[nityam pratiSThitam]` is always involved in `यज्ञे` `[yajJe]` a method of worship.
`इह` `[iha]` Over here, `यः` `[yaH]` the one who `न अनुवर्तयति` `[na anuvartayati]` does not follow `प्रवर्तितम् चक्रम्` `[pravartitam cakram]` the continuous cycle `एवम्` `[evam]` in this way `अघायुः` `[aghAyuH]` spends a lifetime collecting faults. `इन्द्रियारामः` `[indriyArAmaH]` He wanders where his sense organs take him `मोघम्` `[mogham]` and wastes `जीवति` `[jIvati]` his life away.

To comprehend this Shloka, think about all activities of nature (including your body) as a procedure to worship. 
All living beings survive by consuming food. Food is created using rain water- this fact is known to everyone. The fact that rain water is a result of a method of worship is stated in the scriptures such as 



Any method of worship results from activity. An example of such activity is to earn or acquire materials. This activity pans out in a series of transactions 
Activity happens in the environment. In this Shloka, the word 
The word 
In summary, all actions relate to the body and are enabled by the Self. The Self must engage in worship. Worship is the origin of all actions. 
The cycle kept in motion by the Lord runs like this: Bodies of conscious beings comes from food; Food comes due to rain; Rain results from a method of worship; Worship results from activity, put together by the transactions of the doers; activity comes from bodies of conscious beings. The bodies come from food - This is the cycle, which runs in the form of a cause-and-effect chain.
People who do not acknowledge and follow this cycle while actually being in it earn a lot of guilt. They don’t nurture their bodies with the residue of worship. They spend a lifetime gathering and finding fault. These people continue to look for contentment in the sense organs. They do not look for contentment in the Self. Sense organs restrict their field of play. 
With the body and mind nurtured by things other than the residue of worship, the properties of 
In this way, they are said to waste away life without achieving 
The next Shloka explains that only a truly free person isn’t bound to initiate any actions. Such a person can see his Self without the need to achieve or strive for anything.

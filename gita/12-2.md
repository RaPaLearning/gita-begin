`श्री भगवान् उवाच` `[zrI bhagavAn uvAca]` Lord Krishna said - `ये` `[ye]` People who `माम् उपासते` `[mAm upAsate]` worship Me `मयि आवेश्य मनः` `[mayi Avezya manaH]` by committing their mind in Me `नित्य युक्त` `[nitya yukta]` are always engaged. `उपेताः` `[upetAH]` They are endowed with `परया श्रद्धया` `[parayA zraddhayA]` complete trust and dedication. `मे मता` `[me matA]` I consider `ते` `[te]` them `युक्ततमाः` `[yuktatamAH]` to be closest to Me.

The Lord commences His response- 



People who commit their minds to Me do so with complete trust and dedication. They worship Me with extreme affection, with a desire to be with Me always. I consider such people to be closest to Me. 
Meaning- they will reach the ultimate goal easily, without delay. I am the ultimate goal.

`श्री भगवान् उवाच` `[zrI bhagavAn uvAca]` Lord Krishna said- `उभौ` `[ubhau]` Both techniques- `संन्यासः` `[saMnyAsaH]` giving up actions `च` `[ca]` and `कर्मयोगः` `[karmayogaH]` working without being driven by attachments - `निश्श्रेय सकरौ` `[nizzreya sakarau]` lead to [moksha](Moksha). `तयोस्तु` `[tayostu]` Among them, `कर्मयोगः` `[karmayogaH]` work that’s not driven by desire `विशिष्यते` `[viziSyate]` stands out `कर्म संन्यासात्` `[karma saMnyAsAt]` in preference to giving up work itself.

The Lord said – Liberation is achieved by either technique – by contemplating without any activity, or by activity that's not driven by attachments. The latter is available even for a person who is able to contemplate exclusively. These techniques do not need any other support or accessories. 
Among them, [working without attachment](karmayOga_a_defn) is definitely preferred.
How come? This is explained in the next Shloka.

Some exceptions have been made for readability:
ज्ञ is transliterated as jna. E.g., 
_: used for S. For example, [bhakta:] + 
अं is normally transliterated as aM, as shown in the table above. In certain places, it is approximated by 'm' or by 'n'. Ease of reading is given preference over literal accuracy.

`भारत` `[bhArata]` Arjuna, `शरणम् गच्छ` `[zaraNam gaccha]` take refuge `तम् एव` `[tam eva]` in Him alone - `सर्व भावेन` `[sarva bhAvena]` in every way, with all your heart. `प्राप्स्यसि` `[prApsyasi]` You shall attain `शान्तिम्` `[zAntim]` contentment `शाश्वतम् स्थानम्` `[zAzvatam sthAnam]` and the position of eternity `तत् प्रसादात्` `[tat prasAdAt]` by His benevolence.

Things are the way they are, due to the Supreme Lord. Hence, approach Him alone. 
The Supreme Lord controls everything and has tender affection towards those who have taken refuge in Him. Due to that affection, He takes on the role of the charioteer and instructs you. 
Take refuge in Him with all your heart - follow Him wholeheartedly. Otherwise, you will remain ignorant of His reality and will remain driven by your experience of this environment, which is created by the Lord Himself. 
Even then you will not be able to avoid activities such as this war. Acting in this manner would destroy you. 
Hence, do your activities, including the activity of war, 
You will then attain the position of eternity, which has been described in many scriptures –
As in the 
In 
In 
 'The path to the ultimate abode is not known to all. Those who have surrendered to the Lord attain that abode'; 
 'That abode is beyond everything in this world, a place of supreme brilliance. There is nothing superior to it'. 'Those who are guided by the knowledge of the Lord keep their minds under control and reach the ultimate abode'.

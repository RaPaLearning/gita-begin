Chapter 6


Till now, The Lord spoke about 
[working without attachments](karmayoga)
, along with the methods that help in its practice. Now, He explains the method to keep practicing the realization of the Self. It is accomplished by 
[activity](karmayoga)
 and 
[contemplation](jnAnayOga_a_defn)
. Once again, He explains that 
[working without attachment](karmayoga)
 has 
[contemplation](jnAnayOga_a_defn)
 built into it. This is to emphasize the fact that 
[such activity](karmayoga)
 doesnâ€™t need additional methods to realize the Self.

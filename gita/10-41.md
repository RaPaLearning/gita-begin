`यत् यत्` `[yat yat]` What ever `श्रीमत्` `[zrImat]` is endowed with lustre `ऊर्जितम् एव व` `[Urjitam eva va]` or endowed with excellence - `अव​गच्छ त्वम्` `[avagaccha tvam]` realize that `तत् तत् सत्त्वम्` `[tat tat sattvam]` every such entity `विभूतिमत्` `[vibhUtimat]` is under My control. `सम्भवम्` `[sambhavam]` It has taken birth from `अम्श` `[amza]` a piece of `मम` `[mama]` My `तेजः` `[tejaH]` brilliance.

Everything endowed with My control, which are brilliant, lovely, prosperous, or are reputed to start successful ventures: know that they arise from a piece of My brilliance. This 'brilliance' is the ability to overpower everything else. 

Meaning, this specialty arises from a part of the Lord's ability to control everything, which is a part of His unthinkable might.

Chapter 5


The fourth chapter described activities that aren't driven by attachment. Such activities stand out by the knowledge embedded in them. It was said (Chap.4#33) that these activities are pervaded by knowledge. Before that, in the third chapter (see Chap.3#8), it was said that activity is the way to go- even for those who are capable of exclusive contemplation.

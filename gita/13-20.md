`प्रकृतिः` `[prakRtiH]` The material environment `हेतुः उच्यते` `[hetuH ucyate]` is said to be the cause `कार्य कारण कर्तृत्वे` `[kArya kAraNa kartRtve]` of the transactions in the body, the organs and the mind. `पुरुषः` `[puruSaH]` The Self `हेतुः उच्यते` `[hetuH ucyate]` is said to be the space `सुख दुःखानाम् भोक्तृत्वे` `[sukha duHkhAnAm bhoktRtve]` in which happiness and sorrow are experienced.

In this way, the division of work between the environment (the body) and the Self was described. It holds as long as the Self and the body are bound together. 
Next, the reason for the Self to be bound in material experiences is described. Why we are bound this way, even though the Self is pure joy and experiences itself?

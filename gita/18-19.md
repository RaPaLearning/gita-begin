`प्रोच्यते` `[procyate]` It is said that `ज्ञानम्` `[jJAnam]` knowledge, `कर्म` `[karma]` action `च कर्ता` `[ca kartA]` and the doer `त्रिधा एव` `[tridhA eva]` are of three types each. `गुण संख्याने` `[guNa saMkhyAne]` They are enumerated in the [three qualities](satva_rajas_tamas). `गुणभेदतः` `[guNabhedataH]` They go by the distinctions of [those qualities](satva_rajas_tamas_effects). `श्रुणु` `[zruNu]` Listen `यथावत्` `[yathAvat]` to the genuine nature `तानि अपि` `[tAni api]` of that knowledge, action and the doer `अपि` `[api]` as well.

It is said that knowledge, the action and its doer are of three types each, going by the distinctions brought about by the three qualities of [sattva](sattva), [rajas](rajas) and [tamas](tamas). Listen to the distinctions among knowledge, actions and doers in terms of the effects brought about by these three qualities.

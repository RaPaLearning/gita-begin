`ब्रह्मार्पणम्` `[brahmArpaNam]` With the implement of contribution, which is the work of the Lord, `ब्रह्म हविः` `[brahma haviH]` the offering, which is the work of the Lord, `ब्रह्मणा हुतम्` `[brahmaNA hutam]` is offered by a person, who is the work of the Lord, `ब्रह्माग्नौ` `[brahmAgnau]` in the fire, which is the work of the Lord. `ब्रह्मैव तेन गन्तव्यम्` `[brahmaiva tena gantavyam]` The Lord is certainly reached by `ब्रह्म कर्म समाधिना` `[brahma karma samAdhinA]` a person who firmly believes that every activity has the Lord embedded in it.

The person who firmly believes that all actions are pervaded by the Lord will certainly reach the Lord. He will gain the knowledge of the Self with the Lord embedded in it – The Self that’s pervaded by the Lord.
In summary, a person who desires 
In this way, after teaching the knowledge that’s embedded in activity, The Lord goes ahead to describe the different methods of working without being driven by outcomes.

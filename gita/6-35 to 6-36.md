`श्री भगवान् उवाच` `[zrI bhagavAn uvAca]` Lord Krishna said: `महाबाहो` `[mahAbAho]` O one with powerful arms, `असम्शयम्` `[asamzayam]` there is no doubt that `मनो` `[mano]` the mind `चलम्` `[calam]` keeps wandering `दुर्निग्रहम्` `[durnigraham]` and is difficult to control. `तु` `[tu]` However, `कौन्तेय` `[kaunteya]` Arjuna, `अभ्यासेन` `[abhyAsena]` by practice `वैराग्येण च` `[vairAgyeNa ca]` and by preventing oneself from being driven by desire, `गृह्यते` `[gRhyate]` it can be brought under our grip.

Lord Krishna replies- No doubt, the mind is difficult to control. It wanders constantly by its very nature. Even then, it can be brought under control by the excellence of the Self – which results from the practice of its pure form and qualities. 
Moreover, attachment to things other than the Self leads to bondage. With this awareness, we get rid of the thirst for various desires. With this and a little effort from the intellect, the mind can be brought under our grip. 
The pursuit of the Self is indeed impossible – even with very heavy effort – if the mind is not under control. A person needs to bring his mind under control, persevering by the methods described before- being aware of the Self, 
With this, he gains the ability to practice

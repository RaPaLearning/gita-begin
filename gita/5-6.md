```shloka-sa
संन्यासस्तु महाबाहो दुःखम् आप्तुम् अयोगतः ।
```
```shloka-sa-hk
saMnyAsastu mahAbAho duHkham Aptum ayogataH |
```
```shloka-sa
योगयुक्तो मुनिर् ब्रह्म न चिरेण अधिगच्छति ॥ ६ ॥
```
```shloka-sa-hk
yogayukto munir brahma na cireNa adhigacchati || 6 ||
```

`महाबाहो` `[mahAbAho]` Arjuna, `संन्यासः तु` `[saMnyAsaH tu]` giving up everything else to contemplate exclusively `दुःखम्` `[duHkham]` is extremely difficult `आप्तुम्` `[Aptum]` to achieve `अयोगतः` `[ayogataH]` without activity. `योगयुक्तः` `[yogayuktaH]` A person who works without being driven by desire, `मुनिः` `[muniH]` who has the intention to realize the Self, `अधिगच्छति` `[adhigacchati]` will realize `ब्रह्म` `[brahma]` the true nature of the Self `न चिरेण` `[na cireNa]` without delay.

It isn't possible to give up everything else in 
A person who attempts to contemplate the true nature of the Self exclusively would experience extreme difficulty. Due to this difficulty, he would take a very long time to realize the Self.

`अर्जुन उवाच` `[arjuna uvAca]` Arjuna said - `यत् वचः` `[yat vacaH]` The teaching, which `त्वया उक्तम्` `[tvayA uktam]` You have imparted `मत् अनुग्रहाय` `[mat anugrahAya]` for my benefit, out of Love, `परमम् गुह्यम्` `[paramam guhyam]` which is supremely concealed, `अध्यात्म सन्ज्ञितम्` `[adhyAtma sanjJitam]` is the knowledge of the Self. `तेन` `[tena]` By that teaching, `मोहः अयम्` `[mohaH ayam]` this confusion of mine `विगतः` `[vigataH]` is gone.

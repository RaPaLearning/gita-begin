`भारत` `[bhArata]` Arjuna, `सत्त्वम्` `[sattvam]` the quality of [sattva](sattva) `सन्जयति` `[sanjayati]` binds us `सुखे` `[sukhe]` in comfort. `रजः` `[rajaH]` The quality of [rajas](rajas) `कर्मणि` `[karmaNi]` binds us in actions. `तमः` `[tamaH]` The quality of [tamas](tamas) `ज्ञानम् आवृत्य` `[jJAnam AvRtya]` conceals knowledge and `प्रमादे सन्जयति` `[pramAde sanjayati]` binds us in mistakes.

The primary effect of [sattva](sattva) is to bind us in comfort. 
The quality of [rajas](rajas) predominantly addicts us to activity. 
On the other hand, the quality of [tamas](tamas) conceals awareness of the true nature of things. This gives rise to misconceptions. In this way, its main effect is to cause indulgence in work that must not be done, binding us to mistakes and other faults.
The [three qualities](satva_rajas_tamas) are accumulated in the form of a body we own. By their very nature, they bind us to the material world. 
All these [three qualities](satva_rajas_tamas) exist all the time. They generate effects that are opposite to each other - such as awareness and ignorance. How do they generate contradictory effects on the body? This question is answered next.

# Chapter 7

In the first volume (Chapter 1 to Chapter 6), Lord Krishna described the way to realize the Self. This realization is an accessory in the service of the Lord. It is achieved by 
Worship is the means to reach Lord Narayana, who is always present with Lakshmi, who alone is the creator of the universe, who is flawless, who knows everything, who is present in all beings, whose will is always realized, who pervades everything and is beyond the perception of our sense organs. 
Till now, the true nature of the Self, along with the means to realize it was described to be able to explain the worship of the Lord.
In this middle volume (chapter 7 to chapter 12) the nature of the Supreme Lord and His worship, also called bhakti, are described. Several testimonies from the scriptures describe this worship, starting with:
Chap.18#46: Any human being attains the goal by worshipping The Lord with his own work.
Chap.18#54: Having realized the Self, with a serene mind, he doesn't get upset and doesn't yearn. Such a person has equanimity among all beings. He attains the ultimate devotion to Me.

Further, it is stated in the 



By the emphasis laid here, we see that worship is the uninterrupted chain of thought, which makes a person obtain the blessings of the Lord. Since the object of worship is so adorable, the chain of thought called worship itself is lovely. 



This is called bhakti: 'When the uninterrupted chain of thought is filled with friendship, it is called bhakti' -as stated in [laingapurANa,uttarabhAga:].
Further, there are more statements in the scriptures that convey the same meaning:
The 
Chap.11#53, Chap.11#54: The Lord says through these Shlokas: 'Not through the Vedas, not even by penance, not by donating things, not by performing sacrifice - it is not possible to see Me in the way that you do. Arjuna, through devotion alone, it is possible to know Me like this, to see Me in My true form and finally go into Me.
Here, the seventh chapter describes the true form of Lord, who is to be worshipped in this way. It describes that the Lord's form is concealed by the environment ('environment' includes our body).

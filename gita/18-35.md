`पार्थ` `[pArtha]` Arjuna, `यया` `[yayA]` the [resolve](intellect_and_resolve) by which `दुर्मेधा` `[durmedhA]` an ignorant person `न विमुन्चति` `[na vimuncati]` doesn't give up `स्वप्नम्` `[svapnam]` drowsiness, `भयम्` `[bhayam]` fear, `शोकम्` `[zokam]` misery, `विषादम्` `[viSAdam]` dejection `च` `[ca]` and `मदम्` `[madam]` intoxication `सा धृतिः` `[sA dhRtiH]` - such resolve is `तामसी` `[tAmasI]` in [tamas](tamas).

An ignorant person doesn't give up activities that intentionally engage in being drowsy and intoxicated. The mind, body and the organs indulge in the experience of material things to end up in this state. 
With a [resolve](intellect_and_resolve) that's in [tamas](tamas), such people keep getting sluggish and intoxicated. They don’t let-go, tending towards subjects that give fear, misery and dejection.
Such [resolve](intellect_and_resolve) is in [tamas](tamas)- it sustains activities that enhance fear, misery and dejection - be they activities of the mind, activities done using our organs or activities such as breathing.

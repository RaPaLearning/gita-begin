`तत् त्रिविधम् तपः` `[tat trividham tapaH]` When these three disciplines `तप्तम्` `[taptam]` are implemented `युक्तैः` `[yuktaiH]` as The Lord's worship, `नरैः` `[naraiH]` by people `परया श्रद्धया` `[parayA zraddhayA]` with supreme focus, `अफ्ललाकांकाहिभिः` `[aphlalAkAMkAhibhiH]` without being bogged down by expectations, `परिचक्षते` `[paricakSate]` - this is seen as `सात्विकम्` `[sAtvikam]` being in the quality of [sattva](sattva).

People who aren't bogged down by expectations are always with the thought that everything is for the Lord’s worship. They practice the three disciplines of the mind, body and speech with supreme focus. Such discipline is said to be in the quality of [sattva](sattva).

`मे मतिः` `[me matiH]` I consider `अहम् इष्टः स्याम् इति` `[aham iSTaH syAm iti]` Myself to be cherished `ज्ञन यज्णेन` `[jJana yajNena]` by the pursuit of knowledge, `तेन` `[tena]` performed by the person `यः` `[yaH]` who `अध्येष्यते` `[adhyeSyate]` studies `इमम्` `[imam]` this `धर्म्यम्` `[dharmyam]` uplifting `संवादम्` `[saMvAdam]` conversation `आवयोः` `[AvayoH]` of ours.

The word `धर्म्यम्` `[dharmyam]` is translated to 'uplifting' over here. Dharma is the conduct that takes us from our current state-of-being to a superior state.
A person pursues knowledge by studying this uplifting conversation of ours. I am cherished by this pursuit - that's my conviction. 
This pursuit of knowledge was described as `ज्ञानयज्ञ` `[jJAnayajJa]` in Chap.9#15: 'they worship Me by studying the scriptures and understanding the meaning contained in them'. I am adored and worshipped by such study.

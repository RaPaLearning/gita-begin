`ये चैव` `[ye caiva]` All these `सात्विका भावा` `[sAtvikA bhAvA]` feelings of wisdom and virtue, `राजसाः` `[rAjasAH]` passion and activity, `तामसाः च` `[tAmasAH ca]` ignorance and laziness `विद्धि तान्` `[viddhi tAn]` - know that they `मत्त एव इति` `[matta eva iti]` originate from Me. `न तु अहम् तेषु` `[na tu aham teSu]` However, I am not bound in them. `ते मयि` `[te mayi]` They are situated in Me.

You get the point, so there’s no need of further enumeration.
All thoughts and feelings having the 
By virtue of being My body, know that they have Me as the basis of their existence. However, I am not bound in them – I do not depend on them. 
Though the analogy to the Self-and-body is made here, there is a difference. The body exists for the Self to experience. Similarly, the Universe exists for the Lord’s enjoyment. The analogy ends there. In us, the Self is in a state wherein it can receive favors from the body. Unlike this, the Lord does not have any relationship of need with the entities of the universe. They only interest the Lord as a source of amusement.

`प्रपद्येत्` `[prapadyet]` You must [surrender](Sharanagati) `तम् एव` `[tam eva]` to that very `पुरुषम्` `[puruSam]` Person `यतः` `[yataH]` from whom `प्रवृत्तिः` `[pravRttiH]` all existence `प्रसृता` `[prasRtA]` came forth `पुराणी` `[purANI]` long ago.



To get rid of ignorance, we must [surrender](Sharanagati) to that very Person who is the origin of everything - 'that very Person' is the Lord - He described Himself in Chap.9#10: ‘The material environment guides this world according to My will, I being the supreme controller’, in Chap.10#8: ‘I am the origin of everything; Each and every entity gets stimulated with the initiative given by Me’ and in Chap.7#7: ‘There is absolutely nothing else that is superior to Me’.
In the entire created universe, ‘binding activities’ spring forth from the Lord. These binding activities are full of the [three qualities](satva_rajas_tamas_effects) and attachment to experiences. 
The fact that the Lord is the origin and that we must surrender to Him was described by the Lord Himself previously, in Chap.7#14: ‘'These divine creations of Mine are pervaded by the [three qualities](satva_rajas_tamas). They are indeed impossible to cross over. The people who [surrender](Sharanagati) to Me alone - they will cross over this material world’. 
There is an alternate way to read this Shloka - the syllables in [prapadyEt yata: pravr'tti:] can also be read as [prapadya iyata: pravr'tti:], which means 'By [surrender](Sharanagati), the full extent of achievements are possible'. With this reading, the meaning of the Shloka is:
By surrendering to that very Person who is the origin of everything, all achievements - including the freedom from ignorance - come forth in their full extent. This way of [surrender](Sharanagati) is ancient and has been practiced by people who desire [moksha](Moksha). It is in practice since [beginning-less time](beginningless_time). The Lord says here - 'Since ancient times, those who desire [moksha](Moksha) have surrendered to Me and are free from all bonds'.
